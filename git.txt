-> Git is a free and open source tool or software used to keep track any changes made in a particular file and why the change is made. it operates on the principle of creating snapshots or "commits" of a code or source file at different stages, allowing one to revert to previous versions of the file if needed. 

As a result, Git is considered a version control system, and it is a free and open-source VCS that allows one to manage a project and work with other developers as a team in the same workspace.

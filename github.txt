-> What is github?

- While Git is a tool for tracking changes in code locally on a computer, GitHub takes it a step further by bringing this process to the cloud. Its a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. In simpler terms, GitHub is a platform that hosts code and facilitates collaboration with others.

- GitHub allows developers to push their local code repositories to remote servers, providing a backup of their local data and enabling other developers to collaborate on the same project without stepping on each others toes. It introduces an easy way to contribute to projects, propose changes or report issues. Every repository on GitHub has its own URL, making it easy to share projects with others.
